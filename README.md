# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to **predict bike rental demand** based on features like temperature, humidity, season, and time.

It is based on a real-world dataset and demonstrates regression modeling using **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost**, along with data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
